**Documentation: Using the CSV File Parser**

This documentation provides information on how to use the CSV file parser implemented in the given JavaScript code. The provided code is a React component that allows users to upload a CSV file, parse its contents, and perform search operations on the data.

**Usage:**

To use the CSV file parser component, you need to follow these steps:

1. Import the CSV file parser component:

```jsx
import Tabb from "@/components/Tabb";
```

2. Use the parser component in your React application:   

```jsx
export default function Home() {
  // State variables
  // ...

  // Event handlers and other functions
  // ...

  return (
    <div className="p-5">
      {/* Input for file upload and search */}
      {/* ... */}

      {/* Display the parsed data in a table */}
      <Tabb data={data} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Setting up the File Input and Parsing:**

The provided code includes an input element to select and upload a CSV file. When the "Parse" button is clicked, the `readfile()` function is called, which handles the file upload and parsing. The `parse` function from the `papaparse` library is used to parse the CSV data, and the parsed results are stored in the `data` and `mainData` state variables.

2. **Search Functionality:**

The component allows users to search for specific data in the parsed CSV. The search input value is stored in the `search` state variable, and the `handleSearch()` function filters the data based on the search term. The filtered data is stored in the `data` state variable, and it updates dynamically as the user types.

3. **Displaying Parsed Data:**

The parsed data is displayed in a table using the `Tabb` component. The `Tabb` component receives the parsed data through the `data` prop and renders it in a table format. It shows the CSV header row and the corresponding data rows. The `Tabb` component also handles the case when no data is found or when the data contains links (identified by "http" in the value).

**Important Note:**

1. Ensure that you have properly set up React and the required dependencies, including the `papaparse` library, before using the provided code.

2. Make sure to adjust the import paths (`"@/components/ui/input"`, `"@/components/ui/label"`, `"@/components/ui/button"`, etc.) based on your project's actual directory structure.

3. Customize the UI and add necessary error handling based on your project's requirements.

4. If you haven't installed the required libraries, install them using npm or yarn before running the application:

```
npm install papaparse
```

or

```
yarn add papaparse
```

**Summary:**

The provided code demonstrates a React component that enables users to upload and parse a CSV file. Users can search for specific data in the parsed CSV, and the parsed data is displayed in a table format. The `Tabb` component is responsible for rendering the parsed data in a table with the option to handle links in the data. Ensure you have all the dependencies installed and adjust import paths according to your project structure before using the code. Happy coding!
