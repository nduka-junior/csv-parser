# Using the CSV File Parser - Documentation

This documentation provides step-by-step instructions on how to use the CSV file parser implemented in the JavaScript code. The provided code is a React component that allows users to upload a CSV file, parse its contents, and search for specific data in the parsed CSV.

## Usage

To utilize the CSV file parser component, follow these steps:

1. **Import the CSV File Parser Component:**

Make sure you have the CSV file parser component imported into your React application. You can do this using the following import statement:

```jsx
import Tabb from "@/components/Tabb";
```

2. **Implement the CSV File Parser Component:**

Integrate the CSV file parser component within your React application. The component should be part of a parent component and used as follows:

```jsx
export default function Home() {
  // State variables and other necessary functions
  // ...

  return (
    <div className="p-5">
      {/* Input for file upload and search */}
      {/* ... */}

      {/* Display the parsed data in a table */}
      <Tabb data={data} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Setting up the File Input and Parsing:**

The provided code contains an input element that allows users to select and upload a CSV file. When the "Parse" button is clicked, the `readfile()` function is triggered, handling the file upload and parsing process. The `papaparse` library's `parse` function is used to parse the CSV data, and the results are stored in the `data` and `mainData` state variables.

2. **Implementing the Search Functionality:**

The component enables users to search for specific data in the parsed CSV. The search input value is stored in the `search` state variable. The `handleSearch()` function filters the data based on the search term, and the filtered data is stored in the `data` state variable. The search updates dynamically as the user types.

3. **Displaying the Parsed Data:**

The parsed data is displayed in a table using the `Tabb` component. This component receives the parsed data through the `data` prop and renders it in a tabular format. The table displays the CSV header row and the corresponding data rows. The `Tabb` component also handles cases when no data is found or when the data contains links (identified by "http" in the value).

## Important Note

1. Ensure that React and the required dependencies, including the `papaparse` library, are properly set up in your project before using the provided code.

2. Adjust the import paths (`"@/components/ui/input"`, `"@/components/ui/label"`, `"@/components/ui/button"`, etc.) based on your project's directory structure.

3. Customize the user interface (UI) and implement necessary error handling based on your project's specific requirements.

4. If you haven't installed the required libraries, use npm or yarn to install them before running the application:

```
npm install papaparse
```

or

```
yarn add papaparse
```

## Summary

The provided code exemplifies a React component that facilitates users in uploading and parsing a CSV file. Users can search for specific data within the parsed CSV, and the parsed data is presented in a table format. The `Tabb` component handles rendering the parsed data, including the handling of links present in the data. Make sure to have all the dependencies installed and adjust import paths according to your project structure. Happy coding!
